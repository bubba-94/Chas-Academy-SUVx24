# Documentation

## Learning Target

* Integrate living documentation in the team: ***short, code*** relevant and integrated into pull requests in the flow
* Document code on the right level with Python docstring, JSDoc/Doxygen and understand central tags /"docblocks"
* Finish writing consistent with unified codestyle and a voice for faster reviews and less error prone merges.

## Documentation and rapports

Why is it important and of what significance?
Clear documentation and rapporting allows a team to better and quicker understand, reproduce and further develop software without the dependence of individuals.  
It decreases errors, shortens debugging and simplifies transferring of knowledge between teams overtime.  
It also supports longevity, traceing and better deterministics by creating a unified, verifiable source to the truth.

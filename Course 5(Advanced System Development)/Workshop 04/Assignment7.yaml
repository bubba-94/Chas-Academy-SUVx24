# Create a YAML struture where a description exceeds one line with the literal block scalar | operator
# which tells the YAML file to keep everything as written, including row breaks.

# key 
description: | 
  this operator will allow several rows of information 
  like this, 
  and it will still be a valid inside the YAML 

anotherDescription: >
  this operator will allow several rows of information
  like this, 
  but it will not preserve row break. So it will print
  everything in ONE line

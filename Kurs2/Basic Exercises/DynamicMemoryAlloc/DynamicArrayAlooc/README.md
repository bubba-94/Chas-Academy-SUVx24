Write a program that dynamically allocates memory for an array of integers. The program should:
1. Prompt the user to input the size of the array.
2. Allocate memory for the array using the `new` operator.
3. Allow the user to input values into the array.
4. Print the values in the array.
5. Free the dynamically allocated memory.

**Requirements:**
- Use `new[]` to allocate memory for an array.
- Use `delete[]` to deallocate the array memory.

### 1. **Simple Dynamic Memory Allocation**

Write a program that allocates memory for an integer using the `new` operator, assigns a value to it, prints the value, and then deallocates the memory using `delete`.

**Requirements:**
- Allocate memory for a single integer using `new`.
- Assign a value to the allocated memory.
- Print the value stored at that memory location.
- Deallocate the memory using `delete`.

7. Check if a 2D Array is a Square Matrix
Write a program that:

Declares a 2D array.
Asks the user to input the dimensions (rows and columns) and the elements of the array.
Checks if the 2D array is a square matrix (i.e., the number of rows is equal to the number of columns).
Prints whether the matrix is square or not.
Hint: Compare the number of rows and columns.

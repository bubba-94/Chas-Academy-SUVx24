8. Multiply Two Matrices
Write a program that:

Declares two 2D arrays for matrices A and B.
Prompts the user to input values for both matrices (ensure that the number of columns in A is equal to the number of rows in B).
Multiplies the two matrices and prints the result.
Matrix multiplication is defined as:
C[i][j] = sum(A[i][k] * B[k][j]) for all k.
Hint: You'll need triple nested loops for matrix multiplication (two for iteration over rows and columns, and one for summing the product of corresponding elements).

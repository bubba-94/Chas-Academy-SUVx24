4. Transpose of a Matrix
Write a program that:

Declares a 2D array of size 3x3.
Prompts the user to input values into the array.
Computes and prints the transpose of the matrix.
The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping the rows and columns.
For example, element arr[i][j] in the original matrix becomes arr[j][i] in the transposed matrix.
Hint: You can use two nested loops to perform this task.

7. Polymorphism with Virtual Functions
Create a base class Shape with the following:

A virtual function area() that returns the area of the shape.
Now, create two derived classes:

Circle with a private member radius and a function to calculate the area of the circle.
Rectangle with private members length and width and a function to calculate the area of the rectangle.
In main(), create an array of Shape* and store objects of Circle and Rectangle. Use polymorphism to calculate and print the areas of the shapes.

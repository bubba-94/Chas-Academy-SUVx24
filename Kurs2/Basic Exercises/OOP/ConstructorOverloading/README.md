8. Constructor Overloading
Create a class Box with the following:

Private member variables: length, width, and height.
Three constructors:
A default constructor that sets length, width, and height to 1.
A constructor that takes length and width, with a default height of 1.
A constructor that takes length, width, and height.
A function to calculate the volume of the box.
In main(), create Box objects using different constructors and calculate their volumes.

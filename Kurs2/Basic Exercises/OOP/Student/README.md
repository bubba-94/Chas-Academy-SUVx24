4. Student Class with Inheritance
Create a base class Person with the following:

Private member variables: name and age.
A constructor that initializes name and age.
A function display() to display the name and age.
Now, create a derived class Student that:

Inherits from Person.
Adds an additional private member variable rollNumber.
A constructor that initializes name, age, and rollNumber.
A function displayStudent() to display the name, age, and roll number.
In main(), create a Student object and display its details.

Hint: Use the : public inheritance syntax and call the base class constructor from the derived class constructor.

10. Friend Function in a Class
Create a class Complex to represent complex numbers with:

Private member variables real and imaginary.
A constructor to initialize the real and imaginary values.
A member function display() to print the complex number in the form a + bi.
Now, write a friend function addComplex() that adds two Complex numbers and returns the result as a new Complex number.

In main(), create two Complex objects, add them using the friend function, and display the result.

Hint: Friend functions are not member functions but can access private and protected members of the class.

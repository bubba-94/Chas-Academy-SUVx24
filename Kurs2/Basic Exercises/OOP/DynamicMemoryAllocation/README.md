6. Dynamic Memory Allocation for Array (Using Constructors and Destructor)
Create a class DynamicArray that:

Has a private pointer to an integer array (int* arr), and an integer variable size.

A constructor that takes size as a parameter and dynamically allocates memory for the array.

A member function to set the values of the array.

A member function to display the array.

A destructor that deallocates the memory allocated for the array.

In main(), create a DynamicArray object, set values in the array, display the array, 
and allow the destructor to clean up the memory when the object goes out of scope.

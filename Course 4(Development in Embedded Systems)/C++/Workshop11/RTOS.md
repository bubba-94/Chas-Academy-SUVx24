   # Real-time systems

### Questions to think about during studying.
* What is an real-time system?  
  A real time system is a system that demands a task being executed inside a specific time-frame.
* What properties in a system are considered important if you have a real-time perspective?  
  Timelines and coordination between internal clocks in a computer to another computer.
* If our program executes all tasks sequentially, how do that program affect the real-time demands?  
  There will always be a slight time delay since instructions happen in an order, and does not meet the demands of a real-time system.

### Real-time operating systems
* What is a real-time operating system(RTOS)?  
  Is a system/application that utilizes real-time properties to execute and run neccesary tasks.
    * What do they have to do with real-time systems?  
      They utilize the properties of a real-time system and performs tasks/interrupts accordingly. 
    * On what platforms are RTOS usually found?    
      
    * What are some differences between general-purpose OS (GPOS) and real-time OS (RTOS)?  
    * When and why do you want to use RTOS?  
### Scheduling 
* What work is the schudelers main responsibility?  
    * What does it track?  
* When does the scheduler work?  
* How does a scheduler help a system meet real-time demands?

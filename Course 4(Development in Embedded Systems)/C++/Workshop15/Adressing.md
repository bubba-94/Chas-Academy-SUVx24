**Subnet mask**: determines which part of an IP is the "address"(first three octets) and which is the host(last octet).
**NetID**: is the reserved first address (x.x.x.0) in a subnet, all host bits set to 0.
**Broadcast-address**: is the reserved last address available (x.x.x.255) in a subnet, all host bits set to 1.
**HostID range**: is the remaining available addresses inside a subnet that are available between NetID and the Broadcast address.
**Usable hosts** in this [picture](): No clue

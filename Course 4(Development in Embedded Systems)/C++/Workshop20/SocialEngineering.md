8. What does **PICERL** stand for, and how is the model used in cybersecurity incidents?  
    **PICERL** is a model for handling and maybe preventing incidents before they occur.  
    This model provides a six step approach to certain critical safety concerns inside an organization.  
    |**PICERL**|**Brief description**|
    |----------|---------------------|
    |**Preparation**| Establish policies, tools and training before and incident occurs | 
    |**Identification**| Detect and confirm the occurence of an incident |
    |**Containment**| Limit the spread and impact of an incident |
    |**Eradication**| Remove the cause of the incident from the environment |
    |**Recovery**| Restore system to normal operations securely |
    |**Lessons Learned**| Analyze the incident to improve further responses and prevent recurrence |

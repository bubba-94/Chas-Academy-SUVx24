# WiFi

## Common protocols  

* Wi-Fi Protected Access 1, 2, 3(WPA, WPA2, WPA3)
* Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)

### Word descriptions  

* **Cryptographic keys**: strings of characters used with cryptographic algorithms to transform data, making it either readable or unreadable.
* **Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)**: dynamically generates a new key for each packet, or unit of data.
* **Advanced Encryption System (AES)**: provides a stronger encryption compared to the TKIP.  
* **Perfect Forward Secrecy(PFS)**: is a cryptographic feature that ensures (even if a long-term private key is compromised), it cannot be used to decrypt past communications.
* **Virtual Private Network(VPN)**: encrypts all outgoing webtraffic and reroutes it so it is harder to track it to your certain geo-location.

### Wireless Securtiy

* Conduct encryption: Converts data into a code that can be read only by authorized users with the appropriate key.
* Authenticate users and devices: Processes validated identities of individuals and devices that attempt to connect to the network.
* Apply access control rules: Define which users or devices can connect to the network and what degree or level of access they have.
* Secure devices: Includes identifying trusted devices connecting to any network and sets any policies in other integrated security tools.
* Integrate with IDPS and other tools: Catch and block suspicious activities and security breaches in the network.

What does SSID stand for:  

* **SSID (Service Set Identifier)** is the ID for your local network.

What is Wi-Fi Protected Access III (WPA3) and what improvements does it provide compared to previous versions like WPA2:  

* WPA3 has a different and more secure encryption tool called a PFS that ensures that a compromised private key cannot be used to decrypt recvent communications.  

What are WiFi encryption tools:  

* they help defend you device and data when you are using WiFi networks.  
By encrypting data that can later be deciphered by a compatible device and thereby verify communication.

What are five effective ways to ensure ett safe WiFi network according to [this article](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/trends/the-best-security-for-wireless-networks/):  

* Use encryption methods: scaramble network data to complicate the access for sensitive information with the use of security protocols such as WPA2 or WPA3.
* Activate the Router Firewall: for furhter protection against malware, viruses and hackers.
* Protect your SSID: leave personal information out of your SSID to further secure wireless networks.  
* Utilize VPNs: encrypts your webtraffic and reroutes it through a secure and encrypted "tunnel".
* Deploy a Wireless Security Software: improves Wi-Fi network security by incorporating capabilities such as performance analysis, network scanning, site surveys, spectrum analysis, heat mapping, audits, traffic analysis, packet sniffing, penetration testing, monitoring, and management.

What is an "Evil Twin" attack and how do protect yourself against it:  

* An Evil Twin attack is a type of Wi-Fi hacking where an attacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi access point that looks identical to a legitimate one (same name, similar settings) to trick users into connecting.

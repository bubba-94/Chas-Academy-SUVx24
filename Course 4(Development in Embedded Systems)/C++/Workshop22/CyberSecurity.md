# Cyber Securtiy

What is the main goal of cyber security and how are they explained through the CIA triad
    Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the major aspects of any cybersecurity system. These help in maintaining the dependability of any organization during a cyberattack.  
  
* **Confidentiality**: means protecting specific information from illegal access or break-ins.  
This includes controlling access privilege and preventing data leakage.  
We can think of many threats which may include hackers, employees, and physical theft.

* **Intergrity**: integrity is a combination of data accuracy and reliability.  
This concept helps us prevent data modification and ensures that the information is trustworthy.  
The integrity of a system can be protected using methods like Hashing and Digital signatures.

* **Availability**: availability means that the resources are available whenever theyre required by the user or the program.  
Incidents like system failure, natural disasters, and cyberattacks can disrupt the availability of a system.

# Real-time operating systems (RTOS)
* What does it mean if a scheduler is preemptive or non-preemptive?  
    * What does cooperative mean in this subject?  
    * What is (atleast one) part of the software inside a RTOS that we have to reconsider if a sheduler is non-preemptive?
### FreeRTOS
* What does FreeRTOS produce for the software inside our embedded systems?  
* Is the FreeRTOS schedluer preemptive or non-preemptive?  
   * Yes? No? Itâ€™s complicated?  
* What is a task and a co-routine?  
   * What separates them?
   * What does priority mean for a task or a co-routine?  
* Is there a difference on the Arduino delay() and FreeRTOS vTaskDelay()?
* How can we configure FreeRTOS for our embedded systems?

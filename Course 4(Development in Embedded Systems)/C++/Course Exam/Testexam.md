## Theoretical Questions (1–15)

### 1. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)

* a) What is a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)?  
* b) Why is an RTOS preferred in embedded systems over a general-purpose OS?

---

### 2. RTOS Task Management

Describe how tasks are created and managed in FreeRTOS.  
What are the roles of `vTaskDelay` and task priorities?

---

### 3. Semaphores vs Queues

What is the difference between semaphores and queues in FreeRTOS?  
When would you use one over the other?

---

### 4. Communication Protocols

Explain the main differences between UART, SPI, and I²C in terms of:

* Number of wires
* Speed  
* Master/slave configuration

---

### 5. Interrupts

Why are interrupts important in embedded systems?  
Give an example of how an interrupt might be used in a sensor application.

---

### 6. State Machines

Define a finite state machine (FSM) and explain how it is useful in embedded applications.

---

### 7. Power Optimization

Mention three techniques to reduce energy consumption in an embedded system.

---

### 8. Testing Strategies

Describe one strategy for validating the behavior of an embedded system.  
Include a benefit and a limitation.

---

### 9. Cybersecurity Threats

What are two common threats to embedded systems and one method to prevent each?

---

### 10. Secure Communication

What roles do HTTPS and TLS play in embedded systems communication?

---

### 11. Hashing and Data Integrity

How does SHA-256 contribute to data integrity in embedded devices?

---

### 12. Documentation Principles

What does “exhaustive documentation” mean in the context of embedded systems?  
List three good practices.

---

### 13. Hardware/Software Integration

Explain how a temperature sensor (e.g., via I²C) communicates data to software in a microcontroller.

---

### 14. GDPR & Anonymization

What does GDPR require from an embedded system dealing with personal data?  
Give one method of anonymization.

---

### 15. AI Tools & Responsible Use

How can AI tools responsibly assist in embedded system research or development?  
Mention one benefit and one ethical consideration.

---

## Practical Questions (16–19)

### 16. FreeRTOS Scheduling

Write a pseudo-code or C snippet showing two FreeRTOS tasks with different priorities.  
Explain what happens when both are ready to run.

---

### 17. UART Communication

Write a pseudo-code function to send the string “Hello” over UART and wait for a response.

---

### 18. I2C Sensor FSM

Describe a simple state machine for:

* Polling an I2C sensor every second  
* Blinking an LED if the value exceeds a threshold

### 19. Debugging Scenario (SPI)

You’ve built a system with SPI sensors, but values returned are always 0.  
List 3 possible causes and how you'd debug them.

---

**Tip:** Practice writing out full answers and running code snippets if possible. Good documentation and thoughtful structure in answers matter as much as correctness.

---

## Focus Areas to Review

* RTOS (FreeRTOS: Tasks, Semaphores, Queues, EventGroups)
